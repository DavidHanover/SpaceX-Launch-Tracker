Hello!

This is a small React/GraphQL app that uses the SpaceX API found here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API

This app tracks the most recent SpaceX launches & planned launches & gives status information about them.

The app is currently deployed on heroku here: https://hidden-plains-55413.herokuapp.com/

The repository for the client can be found here: https://github.com/DavidHanover/SpaceX-Launch-Tracker-Client

On the front-end, it uses a theme from Bootswatch: https://bootswatch.com/
